The question of BufferedReader
BufferedReader provide a method readLine(), this method regard a line data terminal by '\n', '\r' or '\n''\r' as a String.
I can exit the program of Reader by if sentence.
eg.
String s;
while((s = in.readLine()) != null) {
  if(s.equlsIgnoreCase("exit")) break;
}

if the sentence alter as follow:
String s;
while(in.readLine() != null) {
  s = in.readLine();
  if(s.equlsIgnoreCase("exit") break;
}
  this way is wrong! It will read a time while you called it a time. So the String s save the second readLine(),
and the first readLine() is compare to null. As well the next loop. So we can look a phenomenon the program just 
can read even line input data.

the complete programa:
import java.io.*;
public class TestLog {
	public static void main(String[] args) {		
		try {
			BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
			FileWriter fP = new FileWriter("D:/java/test3.log", true);
			Writer out = new BufferedWriter(fP);
			String s;
			while((s = in.readLine()) != null) {
        if(s.equlasIgnoreCase("exit")) break;
        out.write(s);
      }
			in.close();
			out.close();  //we need close the I/O at the end of the program, or you may can't write data in a file
		} catch(FileNotFoundException e) {e.printStackTrace();}
		catch(IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();}	
	}
}
